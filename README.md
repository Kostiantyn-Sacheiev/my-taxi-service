Welkome to my [first application](https://taxi-service-sacheiev-heroku.herokuapp.com/login)!

# Description:

This application can be useful if you have a purpose to administrate some little (or not very
*:)*
) service which has drivers who drive cars.

It supports authetication, and CRUD operation. Also it is connected to database.

The project is realized in Java and HTML basics. All SOLID principles are used to create this program. The following technologies were used while creating: Java 11 JRE and Intellij IDEA as JDK, Apache Tomcat 9 as Webserver, MySQL 8 server as database management system and MySQL Workbench as a shell, Apache Maven 3.8 as development tool package, JSTL 1.2 as tag library, Java Servlet 4 as layer between HTTP protocol and Java program, Dependency Injector as an inner program technology and a HTTP + CSS for presentation tier implementation. The project implements a three-layer based architecture:
+ DAO - data access Tier
+ Service - business Tier
+ Controllers - presentation Tier

# Features:

1. [/drivers/add](https://taxi-service-sacheiev-heroku.herokuapp.com/drivers/add) - you can create and register new driver
2. [/login](https://taxi-service-sacheiev-heroku.herokuapp.com/login) - login like a driver

**Note:**
